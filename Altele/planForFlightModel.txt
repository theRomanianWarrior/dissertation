1. You got the start holiday and end holiday date
2. Check departure earliest flight in this range.
	2.1. Get flight in that day of week or a later day of week.
	2.2. If not found till end of the week any flights, go to next week till same day we started (one day before actually, to be a week of search). Should be a counter of days till flight found day of week.
	
3. Check return flight, but if date of departure changed, sum it out if holiday period
Here will be reverse logic compared to departure
	3.1. Search for a flight for maximum near of ending of holiday date
		3.1.1. Get day of week and search reverse for a flight. here we also use a counter.
	3.2. If found generate the date of this flight and check if departure date is early return date.
		3.2.1. If departure is not earlier than return flight... Search for  next available return flight in a range later than start searching point
